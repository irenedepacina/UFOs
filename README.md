# UFO's

## Overview of Project
The purpose of this analysis is to use JavaScript and HTML to create a webpage and dynamic table that provides an in-depth analysis of UFO sightings. The HTML page holds an article and the presentation of the table and webpsage. JavaScript displays information in the table and shows when and where the sightings took place and general comments about the UFO. The webpage allows users to filter through multiple critera simultaneously. The sightings can be filtered by city, state, country, and shape. The filters help users narrow down their search and show relevant results. 

## Results
To successfully navigate through the webpage users should use the filters precisely and follow the formats of the placeholders.

The format for each filter are as followed:
- Date: MM/DD/YYYY
- City: lower case letters
- State: lower case letters, abbreviation
- Country: lower case letters, abbreviation
- Shape: lower case letters

## Summary
One drawback of this design is the data. The filters would be most effective with a larger dataset. This can be done by selecting data of UFO sightings spanning over several years and includes countries outside the US. 

Recommendations:
- Include a filter that indicates the time the UFO was sighted. This would deem advantageous in the future as data can show which time of day UFO's tend to appear.
- Include a Clear filter to create a user-friendly experience for those using the webpage. Right now, the user would have to manually delete each filter input but a clear button could delete all the search items at the same time.
